      <p >Our generation generates tonnes of data every second which has to be collected, transformed, cleaned, stored, analyzed, and visualized. This requires new areas of expertise such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>data analyst;</li>
        <li>bi analyst;</li>
        <li>data engineer</li>
        <li>data scientist;</li>
        <li>machine learning;</li>
        <li>artificial intelligence engineer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Specialists in data have to have broad knowledge in mathematics, statistics, computer science as well as in a specific area of interest where data is analyzing. The areas of interest are limited only by our imagination and it can be, for instance, bank, medicine, retail or self-driving cars. Banks collect data from different ATM transactions or credit history which then can be used by applying machine learning technics to choose clients with the higher probability who can get a credit in a bank. After that banks can target the chosen people with the credit offer. Cancer can be detected by analyzing medical X-rays using deep learning algorithms. Self-driving cars collect data from sensors, video cameras, and lasers and then being analyzed by AI methods for farther driving decisions. <br><br> This is a fascinating area of learning, studying, and working in. In this web-blog, I discuss everything related to data, data transformation data analysis, and visualization.</p>
